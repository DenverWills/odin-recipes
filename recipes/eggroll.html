    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indulge in the delightful flavors of homemade egg rolls, featuring a crispy exterior and a savory filling. Start by preparing the filling with finely
            shredded cabbage, julienned carrots, sliced green onions, and minced garlic, all stir-fried together with ground pork or shrimp for a protein-packed
            bite. Season the mixture with soy sauce, sesame oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to enhance the taste. Once the filling is cooked and well-mixed,
            let it cool slightly. Next, lay out your egg roll wrappers on a clean, dry surface. Place a generous spoonful of the filling onto each wrapper,
            positioning it near one corner. Carefully roll the wrapper over the filling, tucking in the sides as you go to create a tight, sealed roll.
                Seal the edges with a dab of water to ensure they stay closed during frying. Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350째F (175째C).
                Fry the egg rolls in batches until they are golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain
                on paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve your homemade egg rolls hot, with a side of sweet and sour sauce or soy sauce for dipping. These
                delicious, crunchy appetizers are perfect for any occasion, bringing a taste of your favorite Chinese restaurant to your home kitchen.</p>
