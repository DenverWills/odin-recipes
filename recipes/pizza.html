    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To create a delicious homemade pizza, start by preparing the dough with flour, water, yeast, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Knead the mixture until smooth and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour. Once the dough has doubled in size, roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Spread a generous layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle a mix of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives. Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) and bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza hot and fresh!</p>
