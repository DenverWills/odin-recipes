    <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
    <p>Delight in the timeless pleasure of homemade cookies, featuring a perfect balance of crisp edges and a chewy center. Begin by creaming together softened butter and both
         granulated and brown sugars until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in pure
          vanilla extract for a rich, aromatic flavor. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and a pinch of salt to ensure even distribution of the leavening
           agent. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing just until combined to avoid overworking the dough. Fold in your favorite mix-ins, such as chocolate
            chips, chopped nuts, or dried fruit, to create your desired cookie variety. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes to prevent spreading during baking. Preheat your oven
             to 350째F (175째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12
              minutes, or until the edges are golden and the centers are set. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to
               cool completely. These homemade cookies, with their irresistible texture and flavor, are perfect for any occasion and sure to be a hit with family and friends.</p>
